# Kevin Huang CS 279R Flask ToDo app

This is a Flask ToDo app based on [Patrick Loeber's tutorial](https://www.python-engineer.com/posts/flask-todo-app/).

The most significant difference between the tutorial implementation and my implementation is that I've added support for hosting on heroku (using gunicorn, postgresql instead of sqlite, etc).

You can access a version online on [heroku](https://kevyhuang-cs279-flask-todo-app.herokuapp.com/).
